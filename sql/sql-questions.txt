1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
select * 
from city 
where population > 100000 
and population < 500000

2. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') 
OR LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, -1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

3. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE upper(SUBSTR(CITY,1,1)) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U') 
AND lower(SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
ORDER BY CITY;

4. Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
SELECT Name
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE Marks > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(Name, 3), ID;

SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4) 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780 
ORDER BY LAT_N
LIMIT 1;

8. Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).
